# Concept: Instantaneous itinerary planning application 

# Idea: 
* Give the app a list of errands and have it give you the optimal times, order, and routes to complete the tasks
* Can add in specific unchangeable appointments
* Can specify specific stores or have the map identify the destinations for you
* Will update in real-time 
* Can Check off tasks as you go
* Can create recurring tasks
